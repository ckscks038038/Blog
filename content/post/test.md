I have been working as a software developer for over 6 months now. Since I work fully remotely, which requires self-discipline and good time management, I sometimes feel unsure about whether I am doing well as a newbie.

Today, I randomly came across an interesting job description for a backend developer position at a company called Teal. It outlines the roadmap for a new backend developer:

---
**At day 1:**
- You've made your first pull request, perhaps a missing test, or readme improvement.

**At 1 week:**
- You have a good idea of how the backend services work.
- You have a few PRs merged into master.

**At 1 month:**
- Monitoring for our system is live, comprehensive, and problematic endpoints identified.
- You are not nearly done, but you have a clear idea of what needs to get done.

**At 3 months:**
- You are fully fluent in our platform, showing us what is possible, what can be improved.
- You are helping us plan major features and ensuring that as we roll out new features and grow, we stay up and stay fast.

I felt overwhelmed as I had never seen such clear criteria for an incoming backend engineer. Coincidentally, I started my software engineer internship just two days ago, and I have decided to use this roadmap as my target to strive for. I believe I have already met the first requirement by making my first pull request. I confidently added a new tag to our product list using React, which was quite exciting.

The next mission is to have a few pull requests merged into the master branch. This will be an interesting challenge for me. I am grateful that the company has provided these guidelines for me to follow.

I often doubt myself along this career path and question whether I am suitable to be an engineer. However, I believe that reflecting on our career decisions and assessing our capabilities are all part of the process. All we need to do is keep going and keep growing.

By the way, the compensation package for this position is $130,000 - $160,000, and it offers full remote work with unlimited vacation and sick days. 

Which is nice...
